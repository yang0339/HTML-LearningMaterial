briefly explore some of the most popular frameworks in a shallow manner.

## JQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. 

## AngularJS

AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. 
In Angular, a controller can be used to implement logic on the model for a view. This two-day data binding allows you to create very dynamic views for your web application.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
Bootstrap was designed for a responsive web. A responsive web page has a layout that adjusts to changes in screen size and resolution by dynamically re-arranging elements to fit. 

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.

## Sass

Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them. Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself.

## AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.

## Node.js

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
